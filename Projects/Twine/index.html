    <h1>Feature Description</h1>
    <p>This is a modal I developed  using React</p>
    <p>Purpose of this modal is to display details of each volunteer log </p>
    <p>Major challenge I faced creating this modal was that due to lac kof access to  dev enviroment.</p><br />
    <p>This meant I was forced to use Heroku to  see my changes  to the code.</p> 
    <p>and to Edit code inside the dev toolx whihc  push to GitHub.</p>
