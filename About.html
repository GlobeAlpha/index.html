                 <h1  class = "SectionTitle"style="font-size:26px;color:yellow">Intro</h1>
                 <p>I am a front-end developer based in Northeast of England.</p>
                 <p> My main tech stack is HTML, CSS, JS and React.</p> 
                 <p>Like an owl I like to collect wisdom specially wisdom that will help me do my job better.</p> 
              
              
              
                 <h1 class = "SectionTitle"style="font-size:26px;color:yellow">Education</h1>
                 <p> I have studied IT L2 as well taught myself basic C++ and Python before I finally got a chance to overcome my fear of JavaScript.</p>
                 <p> I donâ€™t know what I was scared off not only JS is easy to learn but unlike C++ event handling is built in and plus it is a ton easier to develop in JS.</p> 
                 <p> That is not to say that I wonâ€™t start learning C++ or Python again in future however I would prefer to focus on my Front End.</p> 
              
              
                
                 <h1  class = "SectionTitle"style="font-size:26px;color:yellow">Future</h1>
                 <p>I am looking to gain more experience in Front End for at least 2 more years then I hoping to progress into a lead or senior role then full stack I time allows.</p>
                 <p> But I am aiming to develop browser-based games which will allow me to build up enough of Portfolio so I can develop games for other platforms such as Xbox, PS, PC etc..</p> 
                 <p>However, all of this will take at least 5 years, so I am 5 years away from my childhood dream!</p>

                                                <p>My passion for all things computer didn't die I reignted the flame in '12 when I started my IT l2 course </p>
                                                <p>I got to say I was expecting bit more coding in this course however we barely learned basics of HTML/CSS.</p>
                                                <br />
                                                <p>This meant that if i wanted to complete my coursework I needed to learn more.</p>
                                                <p>Once upon a time i went to Library  to find a book the html ,low and behold I found it  in form of Head First 'HTML/CSS'.</p>
                                                <br  />
                                                <p>After this find I decided I am going to complete as many exercises as I possibly could, which allowed me to complete my webssite assigment.</p>
                                <div>
                                <br>
                                
                                <div>
                                <h4 class = "SectionTitle" >Dedicated student ðŸŽ“ </h4>
                                
                                      <p>After leaving College in 2013  I decided to continue studying coding as I left College unsatified what I have learned</p>
                                      <p>I bought a couple of books most notable of whihc was "C++ in Easy Steps" by Mike Mcgrath which I bought with my Christmas money.</p>
                                      <br />
                                      <p>Somewhere alogn the line I realised that learning C++ wasn't  the best option for me as to my knowledge ahdnling events wasn't  as straight forward</p>
                                 <br />
                                 
                                      <p>Eventually I found freeCodeCamp a plaform whihc simplified learning  to code by making completly free and as it was a open soource project anyone could contribute.</p>
                                      <p>1 thing realised as I learned js is that handling events in js was very easy compared to C++ which encorured me to learn more .</p>
                                      <br />
                                
                                      <p>Despite my previous exposure to Html/Css I struggled intially with js  especially considering I didn't have a functioning laptop</p>
                                      <br />
                                      <p>Eventually when I got enough money together I got a tablet however  it wasn't the same as coding with laptop and even access that i had in library or borrwing a machine  limited my abillity to learn.</p>
                                        <br />
                                      <p> After 2 years of setbacks and constant challenges I manaeged to complete Front End Certification on freeCodeCamp with help of youtube.</p>
                                
                                </div>
                                <br>
                                
                                <div>
                                <h5 class = "SectionTitle" >Code Operative </h5>
                               <p>During Late Spring 2018 and early summer I was attending a lot meetups,jobs fairs etc in attempt to find a  my 1st Front End role. </p> 

                              <p>At 1 point I was approached  by 1 of the guys John Evans  who ran Tech4Good at the time invited me to help him found a freelance tech network 'Fractal tech Network'  with another guy Nick W.</p> 
<br />
                              <p>Over next 5 months me,John and Nick  would meet with consultants hired by the council Bob and Rachel discussing our busssiness plan etc </p>

                              <p>In the end we decided name to be Code Operative as Nick W thought about similar idea whilst working as developer 10 years before and to use Copperative  bussines model.</p>

                              <p>Being part of Coperative meant that each member is the owner of the company therefore we all take part in daily operations of the company as well  making decisions such as  our bylaws.</p>

    <br />
                              <p>Over 3 year period I have formalised our vision, organised meeting including social outings etc however running a company even with 8+ people  and working on contracts has proven to quite difficult.</p>

                              <p>As a result of this difficulty my self learning therefore my career progression has stalled in last 6 months alonehowever it isn't all negative as I have learned tremendous amount  whihc will help with my future prospects.</p>

                                
                                </div>
                                
                                <br>
                              
                                <div>
                                <h6 class = "SectionTitle" >What Crystal Ball sees... ðŸ”®</h6>
                                
<p> Once  my career becomes less hectic I am looking to develop several clones of classic video games using Front End tech such as Canvas which I am hoping will start a portfolio of work and teach me basics of game dev.</p>

<p>This over course of next couple of years if not 10 years will allow my web career to progress to the point where I am able to write my own games uaing Unreal or Unity helping me to achieve my dream of developing games.</p>

<br />

<p>And as I can see current market has forgotten what makes video games what they were in the 90's,I thinking of bringing back : Plot!</p>
